This is the Github repository for Eleventh Hour!

- Link if you're looking for [the Ludum Dare page](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/eleventh-hour)
- Link if you're looking to [download the executable from Itch.io](https://plasmastarfish.itch.io/eleventh-hour)

I'm not actively working on this game, so I'm leaving the repository the same way it was at the conclusion of the jam. Feel free to copy, modify, distribute, or otherwise use the code in ways consistent with the included MIT license.
